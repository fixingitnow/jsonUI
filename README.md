# json-ui-project

# Summary 
Consider a CMS(Content Management System) where you can build UIs with drag & drop UI components.
CMS generates a JSON and react project has to render UI as in the screenshot. 

# Goal
You need to come up with a JSON structure and build a react project which includes ui components from the screenshot.

# List of Components
* Input
* Dropdown
* Text
* Textarea
* Textfield
* Image
* Container (Container component might include other components or another container inside of it)

# JSON structure
* I should be able to pass style to every component from JSON. ✅
* I should be able to pass component attributes from JSON (ex: href, src). ✅
* etc.

# Example
* example folder has data.json and data.png which you can check and understand how it worsk

# Result
This task is a little bit ambiguous and we want to know how you would do this. Feel free to use any global state management like redux or context.
* Setup a basic structure from where we can add new comonents to the base and keep rendering them
* This only supports components listed above
* The beauty of component is decided based on the css input so that's a good thing.
* I created a base setup which extensible from here with the given time restriction.
